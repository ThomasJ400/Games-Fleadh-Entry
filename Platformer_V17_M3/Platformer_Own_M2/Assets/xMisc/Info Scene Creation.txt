Each level needs to have all prefabs in controllers dragged in before play-testing.

If you add more levels, make sure to add them to the build settings in order. This is to allow the scene change to it on the previous level.

The door advances to the next level, and the key is required to activate the door.

If starting at any level other than 1 for testing make sure to set current level in GameController object.
Also change the lastLevel on the SceneController object.
After lastLevel has been completed it will return you to the Menu.
